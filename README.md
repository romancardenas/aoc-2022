# Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my answers for the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
This year, I decided to solve the advent of code using the Rust programming language.

The latest activities are solved in `src/main.rs`.
On the other hand, the `examples` folder contains the problems sorted day by day.
For instance, `examples/1_calories.rs` contains the code I used for solving the problem of the first day.
The `data` directory contains the additional data needed to execute the code.
This data is also numbered according to the day when the data was released.
For instance, `data/1_input.txt` corresponds to the data provided for the activities of the first day.

Cheers!
